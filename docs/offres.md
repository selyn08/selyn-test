# Page: Offres & Tarifs (offres.html)

## 1. Purpose

The **Offres & Tarifs** page is designed to present the different subscription plans available at SELYN in a clear and detailed manner. Its main purpose is to help potential clients understand the value of each offer, compare them, and choose the one that best fits their needs and budget. This page is a critical step in the conversion funnel, leading users from interest to action.

## 2. Main Features

The page is structured to guide the user from a high-level overview to a detailed comparison, reinforcing the value proposition along the way.

### Header Navigation

The standard sidebar navigation is present, with the "Offres & Tarifs" link highlighted.

### Hero Section

- **Main Headline**: "Des Offres Flexibles Pour Votre Croissance" (Flexible Offers For Your Growth).
- **Subtitle**: Encourages users to find the perfect formula for their current and future needs.

### Pricing Section

This section displays four main offers in a grid format.

- **Pricing Cards**:
  - **Freemium**: A free starting plan. The "Commencer" (Start) button links to the checkout page with the "Freemium" offer pre-selected.
  - **Pro**: A plan for freelancers. The "Choisir Pro" (Choose Pro) button links to the checkout page.
  - **Business**: The most popular plan for small to medium-sized enterprises (TPE/PME), highlighted with a "Populaire" badge. The "Choisir Business" (Choose Business) button links to the checkout page.
  - **Personnalisée** (Custom): For advanced needs, with a price of "Sur Devis" (On Quote). The "Nous contacter" (Contact Us) button links to the `contact.html` page.
- **URL Parameters**: The checkout links cleverly pass the offer name and price as URL parameters (e.g., `checkout.html?offer=Business&price=3000`), allowing the checkout page to be pre-filled.

### Comparison Table Section

This section provides a granular breakdown of what is included in each plan.

- **Section Title**: "Tableau Comparatif Détaillé" (Detailed Comparison Table).

  - **Rows**: Each row represents a feature (e.g., "Accès Coworking", "SELYN Suite (Finance)").
  - **Columns**: Each column represents a plan (Freemium, Pro, Business, Personnalisée).
  - **Content**: The cells use checkmark icons (`<i class="fas fa-check"></i>`), cross icons (`<i class="fas fa-times"></i>`), or specific text (e.g., "5h/semaine") to indicate whether a feature is included and to what extent.

### Why Invest Section

This final section serves as a closing argument, reinforcing the value of the investment.

- **Section Title**: "Pourquoi Investir dans une Offre SELYN ?" (Why Invest in a SELYN Offer?).
- **Main Text**: Explains that a SELYN plan is an investment in success, saving time and creating opportunities.
- **Visual Stats**: Three icons with labels ("Accélération", "Optimisation", "Connexion") visually summarize the core benefits.

### Footer

The standard site footer is included with all the usual information.

## 3. Navigation

- **Arrival**: Users typically arrive here by clicking the "Offres & Tarifs" link in the main navigation or from calls-to-action on other pages (like the `index.html` pricing preview).
- **Departure**:
  - The primary exit points are the "Commencer" and "Choisir" buttons, which lead the user to the `checkout.html` page to finalize their subscription.
  - The "Nous contacter" button on the custom plan leads to the `contact.html` page.
  - Users can also leave the page using the main navigation or footer links.

## 4. User Guidance

This page is designed for a user who is actively considering a purchase.

- **Quick Comparison**: The **Pricing Section** allows for a quick, high-level comparison of the plans and their target audience.
- **Detailed Analysis**: For users who need more information, the **Comparison Table** is the most important feature. They can use it to precisely compare features side-by-side.
- **Making a Decision**: The "Populaire" badge on the "Business" plan acts as social proof, guiding uncertain users toward the most common choice.
- **Final Push**: The **Why Invest Section** is there to convince users who might be hesitating, by framing the purchase as a strategic investment rather than a cost.
