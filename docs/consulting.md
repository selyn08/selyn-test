## 1. Purpose

The **Selyn Conseil** page details the strategic consulting services offered by SELYN. Its primary purpose is to establish credibility and expertise in key business areas. The page is aimed at potential clients who are facing business challenges or seeking opportunities for growth, and it positions SELYN as a trusted partner to help them achieve their goals.

## 2. Main Features

The page is structured to build confidence by showcasing areas of expertise and backing them up with results.

### Expertise Section (`Nos Domaines d'Intervention`)

This section breaks down the consulting services into three core areas.

### Footer

The standard site footer with contact information and site links is included.

## 3. Navigation

- **Arrival**: Users arrive here by clicking the "Selyn Conseil" link in the main navigation or from the corresponding slide on the `index.html` hero slider.
- **Departure**: This page is primarily informational. The main call to action is implicit: to contact SELYN for consulting services. Users would navigate to the `contact.html` page (via the main navigation or footer) to take the next step. They can also navigate to any other page via the sidebar or footer.

## 4. User Guidance

This page is for users seeking expert business advice.

- **Identifying Needs**: The user should first look at the **Expertise Section** to see if their specific business need (e.g., financing, digital transformation) is covered by SELYN's services.
- **Building Trust**: The **Why Choose Us Section** is critical for building trust. The descriptive text explains *how* SELYN works, while the statistics provide concrete evidence of their effectiveness.
- **Next Step**: A user convinced by this page would be expected to initiate contact. The persistent `Contact` link in the navigation and the contact details in the footer are the logical next steps. The page does not have an explicit "Contact Us Now" button within its main content, relying on the global navigation.
