# Page: Contact (contact.html)

## 1. Purpose

The **Contact** page serves as the primary gateway for communication between users and the SELYN team. Its purpose is to provide multiple ways for users to get in touch, whether by phone, email, physical visit, or a web form. It also aims to reduce the support load by proactively answering common questions in an FAQ section.

## 2. Main Features
